## Overview

VALa1Tokenizer is a custom tokenizer implementation written in Python. It provides tokenization and encoding functionalities for text processing tasks.

## Installation

You can install VALa1Tokenizer via pip:

Here's an improved version of the instructions:

```bash
import os

def run_VALa1Tokenizer():
    # Clone the repository
    os.system("git clone https://github.com/CufoTv/VALa1Tokenizer.git")

    # Navigate to the directory containing the tokenizer
    os.chdir("VALa1Tokenizer")

    # Replace the following command with the desired command to run the tokenizer
    # For example, if you want to list the contents of the directory:
    os.system("ls")

# Example usage
run_VALa1Tokenizer()
```

After running this code, execute the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
cd VALa1Tokenizer
```

If you encounter an error like `[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'VALa1Tokenizer' /content`, it means the Tokenizer is available and you can start using it. Before using it, make sure to install any required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
